# Portfolio Website

This is a fully responsive portfolio website created with [React](https://react.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/). It's deployed to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This app contains links to my socials, an email link that uses the default email service of the device being used, and a resume hosted on google drive. It also contains links to repos for projects on my GitHub that I chose to share.

## Why this app?
* Practice creating responsive webapps with React and flexbox
* Use Vite to start a project. I have previously only stood up projects with Next.js so I wanted to check it out.
